### Notes ###
# This script will perform a scan of files in the target location, using ClamAV.
# The "target location" is passed as a parameter to the "run_clamav_scan.sh" script,
# i.e. run_clamav_scan.sh "/mnt"
#
# If you do not pass a parameter or the parameter passed doesn't exists as a file
# or directory, the script will email you an invalid parameter alert.
#
# Once the parameter has been checked and passed, this script will perform a scan
# of the target location.  Please note, that depending on the amount of files to
# scan this task could take a while (i.e. hours/days).

# ClamAVÂ® is an open source (GPL) anti-virus engine used in a variety of situations
# including email scanning, web scanning, and end point security. It provides a number
# of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line
# scanner and an advanced tool for automatic database updates.

### Updates ###
# 17 March 2020: Updated "run_clamav_scan.sh" as FreeNAS v11.3 has moved iocage to
# "/mnt/tank/iocage" from "/mnt/iocage", which was the location if you manually created
# iocage jails in v11.1 before using the UI in v11.2.
#
# 17 March 2020: Have hashed out the [echo "Content-Type: text/html"] lines as there
# is an issue with FreeNAS v11.3 and sendmail.  With these line(s) enabled the email
# will not be sent, but if you hash (#) it out they are sent! For now I have just hashed
# it out, so the email works - will re enable once the issue is fixed in FreeNAS v11.3-U2:
# (https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-105003).
#
# 24 March 2020: A complete rewrite to improve and fix some minor issues.
# Have updated it as follows:
#	* reduced coding and scripts to now only require a single script to run;
#	* turned all hard-coded log file names into variables;
#	* added in complete setup and usage instructions;
# 	* defining 'root' as the default email (so no need to edit this if happy
#	  with that);
#	* script now requires a parameter of the target location to scan (with error
#	  checking);
# 	* simplified the editing requirements for the endusers who are running in
#	  warden jails instead of iocage;
#	* the script now supports concurrent runs, by using automatically generated
#	  unique files names for the log files.
#	* separated and automated the freshclam update independently from this script,
#	  so you can configure how often you want to update the virus definitions.
#
# 02 April 2020: Noticed a small mistake on the "sendmail" command, it didn't have
# the -oi parameter.  This "bug" didn't effect the running of the script though.
### End ###

### Usage ###
# To use this script you need to follow the instructions as below, examples are done
# using iocage commands (just swap to jexec commands if still using warden jails):
#
# 1) Editing the run_clamav_scan.sh script
#	 There are four user-defined fields within the script.  If you are using iocage, 
#	 and are happy for the email to go to root and using the jail name ClamAV; then 
#	 there is no need to edit any of them.  Otherwise edit as per the notes in that
#	 section of the script.
#
# 2) Creating Jail
#	 Create a new Jail, I recommend its called "ClamAV".  Don't forget to configure
#	 it to auto start on server reboots.  Once created you need to start the Jail:
#
#	 iocage start ClamAV
#
# 3) Installing ClamAV (this will take a while)
#	 You now need to update the Jail and and install ClamAV (using "ports"), once
# 	 finished you can then "exit" the Jail and restart it.  I also recommend you
#	 install "portmaster" which will make managing updates easier - see (7).
#
#	 iocage console ClamAV
#	 pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
#	 portsnap fetch
#	 portsnap extract
#	 cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster
#	 make install clean
#	 cd /usr/ports/security/clamav
#	 make install clean
#	 exit
#	 iocage restart -s ClamAV
#
# 4) Configure freshclam (this updates the virus definition files)
#	 You can now configure freshclam, freshclam needs to be configured to run as
#	 a daemon (i.e. always running within the Jail), to automate definition updates,
#	 based on the amount of updates you want to do each day (default is 12 updates/day).
#
#	 iocage console ClamAV
#	 freshclam
# 	 touch /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
# 	 chmod 600 /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
# 	 chown clamav /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
#
#	 You now need to edit the "freshclam.conf" file, which should be found at
#	 "/usr/local/etc/freshclam.conf".  You will want to edit/check the following
#	 options:
#
#	 Location of freshclam.log file:
#		UpdateLogFile /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
#	 Number of checks (for updates) per day (default is 12):
#		Checks amount
#
#	 You now need to start freshclam as a daemon service, and then exit and stop
#	 the Jail by typing the following commands (this only needs to be done once):
#
#	 sysrc clamav_freshclam_enable="YES"
#	 freshclam -d
#	 exit
#	 iocage stop ClamAV
#
# 5) Add the shares (i.e. datasets) you wish to scan
#	 Using the Jails -> Mount Points feature (I recommend Read-Only mounts).  Remember, 
#	 if the files/directories are not mounted then you will not be able to scan them 
#	 with this script.
#
#	 I recommend you mount them into the /mnt directory and use the same naming scheme
#	 as your datasets (makes it easier to remember), for example:
#
#	 (FreeNAS server)								(ClamAV Jail)
#	 /mnt/tank/Sysadmin		---> mounted to ---->	/mnt/tank/Sysadmin
#	 /mnt/tank/Documents	---> mounted to ---->	/mnt/tank/Documents
#
#	 Once you have configured your mounts you will need to start the Jail again:
#
#	 iocage start ClamAV
#
# 6) Setup a Tasks -> Cron Jobs on the FreeNAS server
#    Run this script with the scan location as a parameter,  i.e. run_clamav_scan.sh "scan target".  
#	 This script does some error checking and then runs the scan - an email will be sent
#	 upon completion.  You can configure multiple scans with different scan locations
#	 and start times based on your needs.  The script can now be run concurrently as
#	 many times as you need!
#
# 7) Updating ClamAV
#	 Over time new versions of ClamAV will be released and you will want to upgrade
#	 to them. You will see a notification that ClamAV is out-of-date in the email
#	 you receive via this script.  Therefore to update the ClamAV installation, you
#	 need to do the following:
#
#	 iocage console ClamAV
#	 portsnap fetch
#	 portsnap update
#	 portmaster -a
#	 exit
#	 iocage restart -s ClamAV
#
#	 The command "portmaster -a" will update all outdated ports within the Jail. If
#	 you wish to see which ports would be updated then you can use the command
#	 "portmaster -L."
### End ###

### User Defined Variables ###
# Hash out (#) the relevant lines depending on whether you are using warden or iocage
# for Jails, if your jails are not in the default location, please update the path
# in the "jail_location" variable:
#
# 	warden = FreeNAS v11.1 and below
# 	iocage = FreeNAS v11.1 and above (yes FreeNAS v11.1 supports both warden and iocage!)

#jail_type="warden"
#jail_location="/mnt/tank/Jails/"
jail_type="iocage"
jail_location="/mnt/JailHDD/iocage/jails/"

## Define the name of the Jail where ClamAV is installed
clamAVJailName="clamav"

# Your email address, so that you can receive the emails generated by this script.
# This defaults to 'root' and thus the email address you have defined for root, if
# you want a different email, please edit appropriately.
your_email=root
