# FreeNAS-Server-ClamAV-Scan

A pair of shell scripts to automate (via a cron job) the anti-virus scan of your FreeNAS shares.

The script will update the ClamAV definitions, then run a scan and prepare an email template.

This script is called from a master script running as a cron job on the FreeNAS server: run_clamav_scan.sh

Instructions:
 1) To use this you need to create a Jail, I recommend "ClamAV"
 2) Install ClamAV using "ports"
 3) You can then "exit" the Jail
 4) Add the windows shares you wish to scan by using the Jail Add Storage feature
 5) Add the shares to same location you use in the variable: "scriptLocation"
 6) Setup a cronjob on the FreeNAS server to run a shell script on the FreeNAS server: "run_clamav_scan.sh"
 7) The shell script "run_clamav_scan.sh" then connects to the Jail and runs this script.
 8) Once finished, the "run_clamav_scan.sh" script emails a log to the email entered in the variable: "toEmail"

ClamAVÂ® is an open source (GPL) anti-virus engine used in a variety of situations including email scanning, web scanning,
and end point security. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command
line scanner and an advanced tool for automatic database updates.
